<h1>Methods on time travel</h1>
<h2>Polarity</h2>
This one has been popular with the locals, i think.
<br>
There would ba a basic setup, 5 and 10 or 5 and 15... And so on and so on.
<br>
Those have common factors and fall apart. Thing is you notch it by one. making it 5 9 or 5 11.
<br>
The implied 10 is longer than 9 making it a system with more exposure and less density.
<br>
The implied 10 is shorter than 11 making it a system with higher energy and more density.
<br>
The 5 9 system would cause you to build up energy, kinetics or stuff like that. God knows walking is hard here, don't ask.
<br>
The 5 11 system woould bitch slap you into common sense. A higher density system would definitly be more stable and more limited in range or scope.
<br>
Depreiated.
<h2>Cones</h2>
Basic layout has 2 nodes and another one in the middle.
<br>
You would select a ratio and apply it to the total length.
<br>
Sounds like fun, but what about the other side of the ratio?
<br>
The polarity method implies a system of 1-2 1-3 ratio. That is bad. I'll get back to this.
<br>
There's no way around thick stuff.
<br>
Drawing 1 to 5, twice.
<br>
1234512345
<br>
Draw all the intervals from 1 to 4. Add the interval offset form one to one.
<br>
123451 x1
<br>
135241 x2
<br>
142531 x3
<br>
154321 x4
<br>
You would notice the sequence is the same as the other one, reversed, on the opposite end.
<br>
So, what side is it really? Both.
<br>
The main problem with the polarity is not it itself. The main problem is the ratio it uses by default. 1 and 2.
<br>
Considering the cones setup, a system of 5 and 6 would imply an additional system of 1 and 6. That is fine and i don't care about all of infinity.
<br>
Except 1 and 2.
<br>
Following the methods it would imply a system of 1 and 1. Which is like any system of like 3 and 3 out of six. What bothers me is the whole absolute implications of one out of one.
<br>
Julia said it best. Everything out of everything is nothing. This here is what worries me. You can't tell everything from everything, there is no landmarks, no way to orient. A fish doesn't know the water it's swimming in.
